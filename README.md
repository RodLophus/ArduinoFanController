### Overview 

Typically, high-performance Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) accelerators are high-power demanding
elements, designed to be mounted in specialized racks with intense
forced airflow systems to assure their functioning within proper thermal
limits. We present here an open-source, Arduino-based, programmable
active cooling system for GPU and FPGA cards that allow their
installation in common computer cases. Only standard components and
simple 3D-printed pieces are employed in our design. We built and have
been continuously using this cooling system for a GPU NVIDIA Tesla V100
and an FPGA Xilinx Alveo U280. The setup is inexpensive and has proved
to be flexible and extremely reliable. Furthermore, it can be easily
adapted for any other card or element requiring similar cooling.
